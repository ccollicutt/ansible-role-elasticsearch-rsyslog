# Rsyslog to Elasticsearch

This is a simple Ansible role for setting up rsyslog to send logs to Elasticsearch. It is only meant to run with Ubuntu Xenial/16.04, and is meant as a starting point or example, not a full-fledged production system. Although I use it like that, because I like to keep Ansible as simple as I can :)
